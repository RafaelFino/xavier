# Xavier
Platform to care what, when e how kids use the internet and their own PCs

## Motivators
My kids loves to join some time surfing on the web or playing PC games (like Roblox or Minecraft) and they learn a lot of interstings things, I don't want to just cut the line, but I need to known what they are watching or put some limits

## The Names
- Xavier: We love Marvel's characters and Professor Charles Xavier spent all his life to care special kids, because of this we choose him to name this project
- Uatu: the watcher is the service that needs just to observe behaviours
- Thanos: destroy the processes that we consider useless

## How we plan to execute?
- To begin, our target is a service abble to run under Windows or Linux, watching all DNS requests msgs and scanning all running processes... but we just observe and store... as Uatu
- After, we will create a external server to process data (metrics and logs) to understand kids behaviour on PCs
- And to finish, we will scan this data and "erase half of universe life", like Thanos
